<h1>COMMODITIES</h1>

There are many things in the world, but most of them are samey. The main differences are price, depreciation and demand.

Price

When a product enters the market in a healthy economy, the price will cover the cost of production and provide a profit. This price changes with supply and demand. 

Depreciation

The longer an item goes unsold, the more it depreciates in value. The value has an effect on demand and therefore the price.

Items that appreciate in value include land, collectibles, and good debt. These will often sell quickly, but the price will not increase beyond the initial posting.

The the value of a person's possession is calculated in their net worth.

When an item depreciates to its salvage value, the owner will try to sell it as scrap, or discard it to save space.

Demand

Demand is elastic or inelastic.

Elastic

These items will sell less when the price is inflated and vice versa.

Inelastic

These items are often necessities. Not everyone needs medicine, but those who need it will pay any price, often borrowing to do so. If they cannot borrow enough to pay for medicine, food, or shelter, death will occur.
