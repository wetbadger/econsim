<h1>GAME MODES</h1>

<h2>Democracy Mode</h2>

Legislation is drafted by a small group of people, elected by the masses. What is popular might not always be what is right. In a severe economic crisis one party might gain an enourmous advantage. They may decide to take over. Unlike dictatorship mode, the player still does not control legislation, rather it is all decided by one man. If things still don't get better, there might be a revolution.

<h2>Dictatorship Mode</h2>

As the supreme leader, you control the central bank and draft all legislation. This gives you complete control over the economy. Should we trust you?

<h1>Economic Systems</h1>

    <h3>Free Market</h3>

    Low taxes, and few social safety nets.

    <h3>Liberal</h3>

    Free market, but with more taxes.

    <h3>Socialist</h3>

    High taxes, and high government spending.

    <h3>Marxist</h3>

    There are no business owners. All profits are shared.

    <h3>Mixed</h3>

    Normal taxes. Normal spending. Just... normal.

    <h3>Kleptocracy</h3>

    The government has a lot of revenue that it doesn't spend.

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<h4>Redistribution</h4>

Give money to those who need it... or who don't need it.

<h4>Universal Basic Income</h4>

Like redistribution, but everybody gets an equal amount.

<h4>Price Fixes</h4>

Is inflation out of control. Is one particular thing too expensive? This limits the price something can be sold for.

Pros:

Combat inflation without printing money.
Cost of living should go down.

Cons:

Scarcity.
More things appear on the black market. 


<h4>Population Control</h4>

Families are only allowed a certain number of kids... or are required to have a certain number of kids. Helps the simulation run smoother.

<h4>Debt</h4>

(See Credit Section for more options.)

<h4>Inheritance</h4>

How much of your wealth can you give to your kids when you die? How much will the government take?

<h4>Crime</h4>

Certain things like stealing and murder are usually illegal. You probably want to keep it that way.

<h3>Consequences</h3>

What happens if someone is caught disobeying the law?

The options are:

Fines, prison terms, and death.

<h3>Prison System</h3>

Is prison for punishment or rehabilitation?

Investing more money into prisons will impove rehabilitation, while longer sentences increase make prison more of a punishment.

<h3>Fear</h3>

How much do people fear the government? More executions, longer prison sentences, and higher fines will make people more afraid. If they aren't scared, they don't need to be as desperate to commit a crime.
