<h1>What is debt?</h1>

A person will attempt to pay a standard cost of living every day. If they cannot make this payment, they will attempt to borrow money. Of course, the first person they will ask is the one with the most money. This lender will offer the borrower an interest rate which they will accept or deny based on their risk tolerance. If a loan cannot be agreed upon, the person will have to go the day without buying anything.

If a person cannot make cost of living payments, they will die sooner.

<h2>INTEREST RATES</h2>

Interest rates are determined by a number of factors.

<h4>Central Bank Interest Rate</h4>

This is controlled entirely by you!

This is the rate at which you reward people for putting their money into savings accounts. Raise this rate and commercial interest rates will follow. Why? Because you would not loan someone money if that money would earn more simply by sitting in a savings acount!

<h4>Credit Risk</h4>

How much loaned money will go into default. If default is very likely, the interest rate must be higher to account for the added risk.

If interests rate are very high, lending will slow down because borrowers are less likely to take on the debt, but people with very high risk tolerance may still take on this debt. Higher interest rates mean more debts will go into default, and the credit risk will climb even higher.


<h3>What can be done to prevent a credit crisis?</h3>

<h4>1. Credit Scores</h4>

This score tells lendors how likely a person is to repay their debts. If credit risk is climbing too high, lenders may choose to only lend to people who have paid their debts in the past.

Credit scores are not an exact science. The way analytics companies track it are a trade secret, but as the central bank, you can assign people your own credit score. If this score has a strong correlation with less amounts of debt being defaulted, than banks will trust this more than the overall credit risk. If there is no correlation, banks will ignore it.

Typically, you want to award points to a borrower who makes payments on time and apply penalties for delinquency and default.

(If there is a negative correlation, lenders may loan more money to people with lower credit scores.)

<h4>2. Bankruptcy</h4>

Allow people to cancel their debt. A high penalty should be added to their credit score.

<h4>3. Interest rate caps</h4>

DO not let lender charge too much interest. They will deny more people loans, but the loans will be less likely to default.

<h4>4. Borrowing limits</h4>

Limit the amount of money that a person is allowed to borrow.

<h4>5. Loan Forgiveness</h4>

If you cancel debt, the amounts owed will simply dissapear. Lenders will count this as defaulting unless you reemburse them. Depending on the severity of a national debt crisis, you may need to print money to cover these costs.
