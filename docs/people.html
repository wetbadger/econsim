<h2>Politicians</h2>

Politicians represent a party. All voters associate themselves with a political alignment based on their individual needs and desires.

Parties form, dissolve, join or split to appeal to as many voters as possible.

A person decides to become a politician if there is demand, and if they are rich enough to campaign. 

Political campaigns are funded by other wealthy people based on their political leanings. 

Campaign finance restrictions can limit the influence of the wealthy and create a more fair Democratic system.

In dictatorship mode, nobody can become a politician.
